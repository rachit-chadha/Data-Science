# Webscraping Project

As a senior majoring in Data Science, I am graduating soon and looking for a job is a priority. To help ease this search process, I created this python script. 

This is a project where I webscraped job postings on Indeed.com for Data Science Positions for DC and Baltimore, MD locations.
I then created a dataframe to save this data as a CSV file to help me in my job searching process.
