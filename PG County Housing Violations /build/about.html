          This project is utilizing the Prince George’s County Open Data Portal
          to get data on housing inspection violations. The application analyzes
          areas with higher violations and pinpoint the specific violations that
          tend to require multiple inspections and legal action.

          For the proposed system, I created a tool that prospective
          homeowners can utilize when they’re considering buying a house in a
          specific area. Users will be able to identify problematic violations
          in the housing area as well as areas with a high amount of housing
          violations. Since the data and metadata we’re looking at is constantly
          being updated on a weekly basis, this tool will be recent enough for
          consistent use in the future. If I can automate the collection of
          data from the PG county data catalog, the application will be helpful
          in organizing the data in a way that anyone can draw the right
          conclusions.

          I've decided to use the FETCH API as an interface to fetch
          resources. This would provide a means to handle requests, returning
          promises and thus resolving responses. We would initially start with
          the FETCH API using its conventions, but as we would go on in the
          semester, I would move from only getting the data to doing more
          asynchronous requests. Regarding front-end technology, I will be
          using HTML to give our web application a frame, CSS to make it
          presentable, bootstrap to give it a template, Javascript to make it
          functional, JSON to enter data, Python FETCH API to handle request and
          response. As I move further in the semester and learn new
          technologies, I would incorporate them as I go along.
